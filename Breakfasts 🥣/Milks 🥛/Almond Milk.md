# Almond Milk

1. ### Ingredients

   - 1 cup of natural almonds
   - 4 cups of filtered water
   - 1 pinch of sea salt / himalayan pink salt
   - *1/2 tsb vanilla extract / vanilla bean*

   

   ### Prep

   1. Soak almonds in water overnight to break down phytic acid

   ### Process

   1. Drain and rince soaked almonds well
   2. In blender, combine almonds, pure water and any sweeteners / additional ingredients
   3. Blend for 2-3 minutes until smooth and creamy (note mixture will expand)
   4. Stain mixture intow large bowl using sprout bag, cheesecloth or thin kitchen towel
   5. Pour into glass and drinkkkk, else leave in fridge for up to 4 days







### Add ons

**Reuse the Pulp**: Save the pulp of the almonds, put on cookie sheet and dehydrate in oven on lowest heat until completely dry. Run through blender or food processor to make almond flour, which can be used in recipes in place of flour. Alternately, just store in the refrigerator for use in baking or smoothies.

**Flavor Variations**: Add ½ cup strawberries for strawberry almond milk, 1-2 TBSP cocoa powder for chocolate almond milk, etc.

**Imitation Store Bought Almond Milk**: This recipe will produce a creamy almond milk that is much better than store bought almond milk. To replicate store-bought low-calorie 2% milk reduce the amount of almonds to ¼ or ½ cup and use the recipe above. 



#### Notes

- Use blender if food processor not sealed/pressurised
- Check only ingredients in blender do you don't explode it like a fucking dumbass
