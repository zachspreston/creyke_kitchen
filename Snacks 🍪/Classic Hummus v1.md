### Process: Making Tahini 

1. **Toast the sesame seeds:** Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly until the seeds become fragrant and very light brown colored, 3 to 5 minutes. Careful as burns easily
2. **Process tahini:** After sesame seeds have cooled, put into food processor and process until a crumbly paste forms (~1 minute)
3. Add 3 tablespoons of the oil and process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple times. Check the tahiniâ€™s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute or add the additional tablespoon of oil
4. Add in salt or other seasonings and process for another 30sec or so

### Process: Making the Hummus 

1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process for 30 seconds more
2. Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice and process for 30sec. Scrape sides then process for 30s more
3. Open, drain and rince the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until thick and quite smooth; 1 to 2 minutes.
4. If hummus too thick or still has tiny bits of chickpea, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water whilst food processor is running until you reach the perfect consistency.
5. Let it cool in refrigerator
