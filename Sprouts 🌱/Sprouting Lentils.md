# Sprouting Lentils







### Sprouting traditional method

- Rince seeds in cold water for 2-5min
- Soak seeds for 12-24h 
- Rince seeds and place seeds in jar/collinder. Ensure that the seeds have alot of ventilation and aren't too wet (ie aren't sitting in water)
- 2-3 times each day, rince the seeds for 2-5min
- Harvest between days 3-6



*To try: instead of soaking for rince then draining, use a squeezy bottle to spray just enough water*
